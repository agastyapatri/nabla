#   **Neural Networks in NumPy**
_Deep Learning from (almost) scratch_

This project exists to make sure that I understand the core concepts of deep learning: **Gradient Descent** and **Backpropagation**. With time, I intend to implement more complicated variants of the Neural Network. 

I intend to write the most performant code I can, but that might take a backseat for haphazard - but understandable - implementations.


### **Notes**
1. `nabla` contains the main source code of the project
2. `nabla.neuron` contains modules to aid in the building of networks. Singular `Linear` and `MLP` classes are provided
3. `nabla.utils` contains utilities to aid in computation.

I seem to be unconsciously copying the `PyTorch` API
