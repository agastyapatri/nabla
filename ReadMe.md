#   **Neural Networks in NumPy**
_Deep Learning from (almost) scratch_

This project exists to make sure that I understand the core concepts of deep learning: **Gradient Descent** and **Backpropagation**. With time, I intend to implement more complicated variants of the Neural Network. 

I intend to write the most performant code I can, but that might take a backseat for haphazard - but understandable - implementations.
